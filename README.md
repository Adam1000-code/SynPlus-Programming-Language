# Syn Plus Programming Language
This is the new Syn lanuguage that is compiled. At the moment, it is still heavily in development and may take a while. The code is mostly from @sebbekarlsson's Tac compiler, which is written in C. Most of the credit goes to him for the code. I will also be taking credit for attempting to replicate his compiler from scratch and heavily modifying it to get it to work the way I want it to.
> To do:
- [x] start and code most of return function in Assembly Frontend
- [x] start output function
- [ ] get the compiler to spit out a string in with the output function
