# Syn+ Programming Language
This is the new Syn lanuguage that is compiled. At the moment, it is still heavily in development and may take a while. The code is mostly from @sebbekarlsson's Tac compiler, which is written in C. Most of the credit goes to him for the code. I will also be taking credit for attempting to replicate his compiler from scratch and heavily modifying it to get it to work the way I want it to.
## To do:
- [x] start and code most of return function in Assembly Frontend
- [x] start output function
- [x] uncontrollably sob at all the segmentation faults because of all the miss-matched memory allocations
- [x] get the compiler to spit out a string/value with the output function
- [x] code escape sequences
- [ ] fix escape sequences
- [ ] fix bugs
- [ ] heavily customize syntax and modify code to be less like the Tac compiler
- [ ] release first public beta (beta 0.74)
