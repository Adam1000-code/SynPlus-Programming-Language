# Syn+ Programming Language
This is the new Syn lanuguage that is compiled for 32 bit systems. At the moment, it is still heavily in development and may take a while. The code is mostly from @sebbekarlsson's Tac compiler, which is written in C. Most of the credit goes to him for the code. I will also be taking credit for attempting to replicate his compiler from scratch and heavily modifying it to get it to work the way I want it to.

## Paused
At the moment, the project is on pause for a while. I recently got a new laptop(MacBook) and I'm still trying to set up all my development tools and personal apps. I also need to figure out how to convert everything to a different assembler, because nasm needs to be installed via HomeBrew and I don't want to use HomeBrew on it. So it will be a while before development resumes. but I have a lot of other cool side projects that I hope you all will enjoy equally as much as this one! But for now, that's it.
Cheers! - Adam
